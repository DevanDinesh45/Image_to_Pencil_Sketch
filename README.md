# Image_to_Pencil_Sketch

I taken the image from google and uploaded it to the google colab drive. After this I imported the CV2 library and read the image from the content , then convert the image to greyscale, then using the gaussian function we process the image now we can easily convert it into the pencil sketch. 
This is how I finished my project 😁🎉
